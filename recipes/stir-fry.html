        <h1>Tofu Stir-Fry</h1>

        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>Tofu can be a hard sell. There are many complaints about its bland texture and flavor, but when given a special treatment, a transformation takes place. This recipe calls for extra-firm tofu that has been frozen, a trick my mom taught me. Once defrosted, you’ll see that the tofu has become more porous, almost sponge-like: this new texture enables it to absorb flavors more readily. It works perfectly in a stir-fry and equally well in soups and stews. Another one of mom’s tricks? To simmer the tofu in salted water briefly before stir-frying. Apparently this makes the tofu hardier and less likely to crumble when jostled in the pan. I don’t question my mother’s wisdom, but this step is totally optional.</p>

        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
        <ul>
            <li>1 block extra-firm tofu, fresh or frozen and defrosted</li>
            <li>1 tbsp low-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tbsp low-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 small carrots, sliced</li>
            <li>1 small head broccoli, cut into florets</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, seeded and sliced</li>
            <li>1 tbsp packed brown sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
    
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium pot of salted boiling water, simmer tofu for 2 minutes. If using frozen tofu, simmer until completely defrosted. Remove from heat and let drain in a colander lined with paper towels. When cool enough to handle, gently squeeze and pat dry. If using frozen tofu, use firmer pressure to squeeze out water.</li>
            <li>Cut tofu into bite-sized pieces, then toss together with soy sauce, sesame oil, and black pepper in a medium bowl. Once liquids are absorbed, toss tofu with cornstarch. </li>
            <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat 2 tablespoons oil. Add tofu and let cook until golden on all sides, turning occasionally, 7 to 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, and remove from skillet and set aside. </li>
            <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil and add in garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Stir in string beans, carrots, broccoli, red pepper, and green onions. Cook until tender, about 8 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, stir together soy sauce, sesame oil, water, brown sugar, and cornstarch. Return tofu to skillet and add sauce mixture to pan. Stir and cook until slightly thickened, 2 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
