        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>Always a reliable option when you’re craving something lighter than a classic hamburger, turkey burgers are a summer cookout staple here at Delish. While they can have a reputation for being dry and bland, made right, they’re anything but. We love our recipe for one simple reason: We let it be. Instead of trying to make it into something it’s not, we embraced the flavors of the turkey instead of trying to cover 'em up. Whether you're making these in a skillet on the stovetop like we did or are taking them to the grill when the weather is nice, these turkey burgers are a flavorful, lean option that just might rival your favorite beef burgers. Enjoy them as is or top them with whatever toppings you can think of—these turkey burgers can take it all.</p>
