        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
        <ul>
            <li>2 cans black beans, rinsed and drained</li>
            <li>8 tostadas</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°. In a small saucepan over medium heat, add beans and 1 cup of water. Bring to a simmer and let simmer until beans are warmed through, about 10 minutes. Smash with a wooden spoon until most of the beans are smashed with some whole remaining. Add more water as needed to help create a smoother consistency. </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, place tostadas on a large baking sheet and sprinkle cheese evenly over each. Bake until cheese is melty, about 5 minutes. </li>
            <li>Top tostadas with beans, avocado slices, and hot sauce.</li>
